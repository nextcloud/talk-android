For example, rather than recomposing on every scroll position change, only recomposing if the scroll position changes from 0 (at the top of the list) to greater than 0 (not at the top of the list), and vice versa.\n- Using snapshotFlow to create a flow of changes from a provided state. This can then be collected inside a LaunchedEffect, and used to make changes without needing to recompose.\n- If using Compose UI, read this value inside measure / layout / draw, depending on where it is needed. This will cause invalidation of the corresponding phase, instead of a recomposition. See developer.android.com for more information on Jetpack Compose phases."
