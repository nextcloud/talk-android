## Why is this so awesome?
Because it is self hosted!!! Audio/video calls and text chat typically require a central server. Some projects go commendably far in trying to ensure they can't see the data, so nobody, not government, advertising company or somebody who broke in the servers, can follow conversations. But the servers still have to mediate every call and text message, allowing them to map out who talks to who and at what time. This 'metadata' [is as useful](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/data-and-goliath-nsa-metadata-spying-your-secrets/), if not more, to track people, than the full content, especially for mass surveillance purposes. Even if the data is not stored by the chat server, the hosting provider or a hacker could simply gather the data.

By hosting your own server, all meta data stays on your server and thus under your control!

If you have suggestions or problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-android/issues) or contribute directly :)


### Installing

Nextcloud Talk is really easy to install. You just need to enable the app from the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed) and everything will work out of the box.

There are some scenarios (users behind strict firewalls / symmetric NATs) where a TURN server is needed. That's a bit more tricky installation, but the guys from [Nextcloud VM](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm) has developed a script which takes care of everything for you. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/apps/talk.sh). The script is tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04, but should work on 16.04 as well. Please keep in mind that it's developed for the VM specifically and any issues should be reported in that repo, not here.

Here's a short [video](https://youtu.be/KdTsWIy4eN0) on how it's done.
